FundForecast Pro: Startup Break-Even & Success Prediction
Project Overview
FundForecast Pro is a machine learning application designed to help startup founders and investors predict the financial break-even point (in months) for early-stage startups and estimate their probability of success. Using real-world startup data, the project employs powerful models like Random Forest and XGBoost for regression (break-even months prediction) and classification (success/failure prediction).

The project also integrates SHAP for explainable AI, allowing users to understand which features most influence the predictions.

Features
Predicts break-even months based on funding, revenue, burn rate, and more.

Classifies startups into likely success or failure using key financial and business metrics.

Provides feature importance and explanations with SHAP values.

Interactive web app built with Streamlit for real-time user inputs and results.

Easy model deployment and sharable app via Streamlit Community Cloud.

Technologies Used
Python

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

XGBoost

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Streamlit for interactive web UI

joblib for model saving/loading

matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations

Installation & Setup
Clone this repository or download the files.

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

Install required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Streamlit app:

bash
streamlit run app.py
A browser window should open automatically. If not, visit http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

Usage
Enter startup parameters such as industry, funding, revenue, burn rate, number of employees, etc.

Click Predict to get the estimated break-even month and success probability.

View SHAP feature importance to understand which factors affect the predictions most.
